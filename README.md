# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/).
In this project, data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved, worked with, and cleaned, to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Dataset

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project/).

This repository contains the following files:
* README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
* FinalData.txt, which contains the data set.
* CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
* run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set
